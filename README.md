# RNA-Seq analysis

In this repo, I will be creating scripts for RNA-Seq analysis. The scripts provided will be able to run using slurm and nextflow.

## 1. SLURM
To download the scripts meant for slurm only, type the following command in your command line interface (HTC/PSC for Pitt users).

```
# first check the files available for download
svn ls https://github.com/anishbhaswanth/rnaseq/trunk/src/slurm/

# then download the files using the following command
svn checkout https://github.com/anishbhaswanth/rnaseq/trunk/src/slurm/
```

Note that, the original path https://github.com/anishbhaswanth/rnaseq/tree/main/src/slurm has been replaced by https://github.com/anishbhaswanth/rnaseq/trunk/src/slurm/.
